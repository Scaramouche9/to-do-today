## About <a name = "about"></a>

Overview:
A no-nonsense app that creates lists, letting users add, delete, reorder, and cross off items

Tools used:
This app was built using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript ES6 languages. I customized html and css templates and wrote the JavaScript for this app using the jQuery library.

Future plans:
I intend to add an event listener to the add button for when the user presses 'Enter' in addition to pressing the button itself. The design is intended to be reminiscent of a pad of paper on a desk, and I'd like to add more effects and textures to make this more realistic.

## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

To open:
Clone the code and open the index.html file on your browser.

Getting started:
Type entries in the input space, drag item up or down to adjust placement in list, click 'x' to delete item
